Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a deep learning architecture. It trains two neural networks in a competitive process, the generator and the discriminator. The generator's job is to create realistic-looking data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real data and data generated by the generator. Over time, both networks improve, with the generator producing increasingly realistic outputs, and the discriminator becoming better at spotting fakes. While GANs have revolutionized several fields by enabling the generation of high-quality images, audio, and even text, they are particularly notable in the field of image generation. GANs' capacity to learn and reproduce intricate patterns has made them invaluable in creative industries, scientific research, and virtual environments. A particularly fascinating application of GANs is their ability to imitate famous artistic styles, generating outputs that closely resemble the works of renowned artists. While GAN generate realististic looking data from scratch, CycleGAN is specifically designed for image-to-image translation without paired examples. It can convert images from one domain to another (e.g., transforming photos into Monet paintings) without needing paired examples of the input and output images.

In this project, CycleGAN is applied to Monet Painting Dataset to generate images in the style of the famous impressionist painter Claude Monet.
